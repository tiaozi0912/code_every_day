### Q7
Rotate a one-dimensional array of n elements to the right by k steps. For instance, with n=7 and k=1, the array {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} is rotated to {b, c, d, e, f, gï¼Œ a}. If k = 3 instead of 1, then is rotated to {e, f, g, a, b, c, d}. Required in-place rotation method, which means space complexity is O(1).

### Q6
Given a target number, and a series of candidate numbers, print out all combinations, so that the sum of candidate numbers equals to the target. Here order is not important, so donâ€™t print the duplicated combination. e.g. target is 7, candidate is 2,3,6,7. Output should be 7 and 3+2+2 (but not print 2+3+2, 2+2+3)

### Q5
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S.  O(N2) time complexity. A palindrome is a string which reads the same in both direction. Ex. "aba"

[Here is the solution of O(N2) time and O(1) space](http://leetcode.com/2011/11/longest-palindromic-substring-part-i.html#crayon-52e10cfadb7a7)

### Q4
Find the sub array with the biggest sum. E.x. 
+ [-1, 1, 5, 4, -1] => sub array with biggest sum is [1, 5, 4]
+ [-1, 1, 5, 4, -1, 2] => sub array with biggest sum is [1, 5, 4, -1, 2]
