 * There are n coins in a line. (Assume n is even). 
 * Two players take turns to take a coin from one of the ends of the line until there are no more coins left. 
 * The player with the larger amount of money wins.
 * Would you rather go first or second? Does it matter?
 * Assume that you go first, describe an algorithm to compute the maximum amount of money you can win.
