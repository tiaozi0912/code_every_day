/*****************************************
 * Rotate a one-dimensional array of n elements to the right by k steps. 
 * For instance, with n=7 and k=1, the array {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} 
 * is rotated to {b, c, d, e, f, gï¼Œ a}. If k = 3 instead of 1, then 
 * is rotated to {e, f, g, a, b, c, d}.
 * Required in-place rotation method, which means space complexity is O(1).
